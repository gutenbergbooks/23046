<p>This text of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is from Volume I of the
nine-volume 1863 Cambridge edition of Shakespeare. The Preface (<a class
= "external" href = "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23041" target =
"_blank">e-text 23041</a>) and the other plays from this volume are each
available as separate e-texts.</p>

<p>General Notes are in their original location at the end of the play,
followed by the text-critical notes originally printed at the bottom of
each page. All notes are hyperlinked in both directions. In dialogue,
a&nbsp;link from a speaker’s name generally means that the note applies
to an entire line or group of lines.</p>

<p>Line numbers&mdash;shown in the right margin and used for all
notes&mdash;are from the original text. In prose passages the exact line
counts will depend on your browser settings, and will probably be
different from the displayed numbers. Stage directions were not included
in the line numbering.</p>

<p>In the spelling of the name of ‘Solinus’ we have followed the first
Folio. In the subsequent Folios it was altered, most probably by an
accident in F<sub>2</sub> to ‘Salinus.’ The name occurs only once in the
copies, and that in the first line of the text. The name which we have
given as ‘Antipholus’ is spelt indifferently thus, and ‘Antipholis’ in
the Folios. It will hardly be doubted that the lines in the rhyming
passage, <a href = "#lineIII_2_2">III. 2. 2,&nbsp;4</a>, where the
Folios read ‘Antipholus,’ are correctly amended by Capell, and prove
that ‘Antipholus’ is the spelling of Shakespeare. Either word is
evidently corrupted from ‘Antiphilus.’ These names are merely arbitrary,
but the surnames, ‘Erotes’ and ‘Sereptus,’ are most probably errors for
‘Errans,’ or ‘Erraticus’ and ‘Surreptus,’ of which the latter is plainly
derived from Plautus’ <i>Menæchmus Surreptus</i>, a&nbsp;well-known
character in Shakespeare’s day: see Brian Melbancke’s <i>Philotimus</i>
(1582), p.&nbsp;160: ‘Thou art like Menechmus Subreptus his wife ...
whose “husband shall not neede to be justice of peace” for she “will
have a charter to make her justice of coram.”’ See <a class = "external"

target = "_blank"><i>Merry Wives</i>, I.&nbsp;1. 4,&nbsp;5</a>. In
spelling ‘Syracusian’ instead of ‘Syracusan’ we follow the practice of
the Folios in an indifferent matter. ‘Epidamnum’ not ‘Epidamium’ is
found in the English translation of the <i>Menæchmi</i>, 1595, so the
latter form in F<sub>1</sub> is probably a printer’s error.</p>

<p><a href = "#sceneI_2">I. 2. 1</a>. That this scene is laid at the

<p>‘I could not speak with Dromio since at first</p>

<p>As this play is derived from a classical prototype, Capell has
supposed
<span class = "pagenum">463</span>
<a name = "page463" id = "page463"> </a>
no change of scene, but lays the whole action in ‘a&nbsp;Publick Place;’

<p><a href = "#lineII_1_30">II. 1. 30</a>. Johnson’s ingenious
conjecture may have been suggested to him by a passage in <i>As you like
it</i>, IV. 3. 17:</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.’</p>

<p>But the received reading of the Folios is perhaps confirmed by a line
in the present play, <a href = "#lineIII_2_7">III. 2. 7</a>:</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth.’</p>

<p><a href = "#lineII_1_108">II. 1. 108 sqq.</a> The only correction of
this passage which we believe to be quite free from doubt is that in
<a href = "#lineII_1_112">line <ins class = "correction"

<p><a href = "#lineIV_2_38">IV. 2. 38</a>. Grey’s conjecture of ‘lanes’
for ‘lands’ is made somewhat more probable by the existence of copies of
F<sub>1</sub> in which the word appears ‘lans.’ A&nbsp;corrector would
naturally change this rather to ‘lands’ than to ‘lanes,’ because of the
rhyme.</p>

<p><a href = "#lineIV_2_46">IV. 2. 46</a>. The Folios have ‘send him
Mistris redemption,’ and Rowe, by his punctuation and capital R, made
Dromio call Luciana ‘Redemption.’ Pope and Theobald seem to have
followed him, though they give the small r. The Folios cannot be made
chargeable with this error, for the comma does not regularly follow
vocatives in these editions where we expect it. There is no comma, for
instance, following the word ‘Mistress’ in <a href = "#lineIV_3_75">IV.

probably be better printed ‘’ears’ for ‘years;’ for a

the following words. A&nbsp;very farfetched explanation has been offered
by Steevens, and accepted by Delius and, we believe,
<span class = "pagenum">464</span>
<a name = "page464" id = "page464"> </a>
by all the modern editors, namely, that Antipholus has wrung Dromio’s

<p><a href = "#lineV_1_399">V. 1. 399</a>. The number Thirty-three has
been altered by editors to bring the figures into harmony with other
periods named in the play. From <a href = "#lineI_1_126">I. 1. 126</a>,
<a href = "#lineI_1_133">133</a> the age of Antipholus has been computed
at twenty-three; from I. 1. 126 and <a href = "#lineV_1_308">V. 1.
308</a> we derive twenty-five. The Duke says he has been patron to
Antipholus for twenty years, <a href = "#lineV_1_325">V. 1. 325</a>; but
three or five seems too small an age to assign for the commencement of
this patronage. Antipholus saved the Duke’s life in the wars ‘long
since,’ <a href = "#lineV_1_161">V. 1. 161</a>, <a href =
"#lineV_1_191">191</a>. His ‘long experience’ of his wife’s ‘wisdom’ and
her ‘years’ are mentioned, <a href = "#lineIII_1_89">III. 1. 89, 90</a>.
But Shakespeare probably did not compute the result of his own figures
with any great care or accuracy.</p>

<p>The general Preface (<a class = "external" href =

17th- and 18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century)
editions are simply listed by name. The following editions may appear in
the Notes. All inset text is quoted from the Preface.</p>

“The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio in the
same order, and ... were there printed for the first time.”</p>

<p><b>Early editions</b>:<br>
Rowe 1709<br>
Pope 1715</p>
<p class = "inset">
“Pope was the first to indicate the <i>place</i> of each new scene; as,
for instance, <i>Tempest</i>, I. 1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also
subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making a fresh
scene whenever a new character entered&mdash;an arrangement followed by
Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of reference to these
editions, we have always recorded the commencement of Pope’s
scenes.”</p>
